						<h2>Leafcutter Bee</h2>
						<p>To line their nests, leafcutter bees will take small, circular sections of leaves and overlap them within a small found cavity. No need to worry about the cuttings damaging the leafs or flowers, as their strong pollinating power more than makes up for it.</p>

							<h3>Life as a Solitary Bee</h3>
							<p>Leafcutter bees are solitary bees, meaning instead of living in a hive with a queen like honey bees, every female leafcutter bee is fertile and the sole provider for their eggs. That is not to say that they live alone, as leafcutter bees are perfectly happy to live as neighbors in a home of hollow canes.</p>
							<h3>Super Pollinator</h3>
							<p>Leafcutter bees are incredible pollinators, as their whole fuzzy body is used to collect the pollen from flowers instead of just special carriers on their hind legs like honey bees. Thanks to this gardens can flourish under their care.</p>

							<h3>Your Leafcutter Bees Home</h3>
							<p>With your adopted family of leafcutter bees, we provide you with a nest specifically for them. Unlike Honey Bees that live in a hive, leafcutter bees prefer nests with hollow canes or burrowed holes. Our nest has hollow canes fitted within a wooden house frame. It can be easily mounted to the side of a house or on a tree. Leafcutter bees have a short flying range of 100 meters from their nest, so make sure flowers are nearby. The female bees will line the canes with leaves and lay their eggs within. They will also place food inside for when they begin hatching.</p>

						<h2>Interested in Adopting?</h2>
						<p>In our adoption process we first ask you about your region to make sure only bees that can thrive in your area are recommended. Due to this leafcutter bees may not be suitable for you. <a class="text-link" href="adopt-region.html">Start the adoption process to figure out if leafcutter bees are native to you!</a></p>
